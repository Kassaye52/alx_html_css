    <h1>The Definition of Cancer</h1>
    <p>Cancer is a disease in which some of the body’s cells grow uncontrollably and spread to other parts of the body.</p>

    <h2>Differences between Cancer Cells and Normal Cells</h2>
    <p>Ignore signals that normally tell cells to stop dividing or to die (a process known as programmed cell death, or apoptosis).</p>
    <p>Invade into nearby areas and spread to other areas of the body. Normal cells stop growing when they encounter other cells, and most normal cells do not move around the body.</p>

    <h3>How Does Cancer Develop?</h3>
    <p>Cancer is a genetic disease—that is, it is caused by changes to genes that control the way our cells function, especially how they grow and divide.</p>
